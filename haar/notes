rspec is very nice, clean, expressive
we are very early into it but impressed
autospec is badass, but need to look into color coding

learned basics of raising exceptions and you need lambda in rspec to catch
them
<action> unless/if <conditional> syntax
no need for loops with each_slice (pretty awesome) and map
ruby seems to stay away from arrow head code

this is interesting:
    current.each_slice(2) { |a| pairs.push a }
  remark about enumerators and how we have to have paran's there

with the map call we couldn't use return (which exited the whole function not
just map)
had to use the variable to get the value.
look into ruby having only expressions 

inject and transpose are cool array method

private methods c++ like, requiring a section header like syntax
